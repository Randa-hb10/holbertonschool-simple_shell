HSH(1)                     Simple Shell Manual                     HSH(1)

NAME
       hsh - a simple UNIX command line interpreter

SYNOPSIS
       ./hsh

DESCRIPTION
       hsh is a simple UNIX command line interpreter written in C.
       It executes commands read from standard input using system calls.

       The shell supports both interactive and non-interactive modes and
       mimics the basic behavior of /bin/sh.

       This project was developed as part of the Holberton School
       curriculum.

MODES
       Interactive Mode
              When standard input is connected to a terminal, hsh
              displays a prompt and waits for user input.

              Example:
                     $ ./hsh
                     ($) ls
                     ($) exit

       Non-Interactive Mode
              When standard input is not connected to a terminal, hsh
              reads commands from standard input without displaying
              a prompt.

              Example:
                     $ echo "ls" | ./hsh

BUILT-IN COMMANDS
       exit
              Exit the shell.

              Usage:
                     exit

COMMAND EXECUTION
       The shell executes commands using the following steps:

       - Read input using getline()
       - Parse input into tokens using strtok()
       - Resolve the command path using the PATH environment variable
       - Create a child process using fork()
       - Execute the command using execve()
       - Wait for the child process using wait()

       If the command contains a '/', it is executed directly.
       Otherwise, the shell searches for the command in the PATH
       environment variable.

ERROR HANDLING
       If a command cannot be found, hsh prints an error message
       identical to /bin/sh, except that the program name matches argv[0].

       Example:
              ./hsh: 1: command: not found

EOF HANDLING
       hsh properly handles End Of File (EOF).

       Pressing Ctrl+D causes the shell to exit gracefully.

ENVIRONMENT
       hsh inherits the environment from the parent process.
       The PATH environment variable is used to locate executable files.

              Program entry point.

       shell.c
              Contains the main shell loop and prompt handling.

       parser.c
              Handles input parsing and tokenization.

       executor.c
              Responsible for process creation and command execution.

       path.c
              Handles PATH resolution and command lookup.
